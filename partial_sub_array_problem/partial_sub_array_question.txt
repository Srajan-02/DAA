Consider an array A of length N, that contains integers, such that the integers in A satisfy the following conditions:

 (i). A[i] = A[i+2]-1, where i<n-2

(ii). A[0]<A[1]

 If an array satisfies the above condition, we call such array as “Partial-Array”.

is partial since it satisfies the above condition.

 a.      Given any “Partial-Array(A)”, design an algorithm and write the program to arrange the elements of A in an increasing order in such a way that your algorithm should comply with the following conditions

(i). Algorithm should do only swap operation that too among the adjacent indices (i.e., You can swap (A[i], A[i+1]) where (i<n-1) or swap (A[i], A[i-1]) where (i>0).

(ii). You must do all the operations with the given input array only and you are not allowed to create secondary array for the purpose.
